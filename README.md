# Personal-Goal-Tracker Application
I've been trying to meet my goals, and I've created a system that works fairly well for me after being disappointed with what was available elsewhere. 
So, I want to make a program that will match the system I've been using in my head, as well as correct the features I've seen in some other applications.
Other programs tend to be plagued by bloat, annoying set-up, aggressive in-app purchases, poor UI or instructions, etc.

Also, from a desgin point of view, each app I've tried tends to be focused on just "goals" or "tasks", rather than both. Ideally you set a goal and then use tasks to achieve that goal.
For example, if my "goal" was to lose weight, a "task" would be to exercise. Speaking of, another problem with goal-tracking apps is that they are usually hyper-focused on certain things.
Exercise (sometimes partnered with your fitbit), nutrition, and amount of sleep seems to be the goals their site is built around, but setting custom goals rarely works as well.

I want my application to work for any kind of goal. For example, making this application is one of my goals. I also intend to implement an AI assistant that will help you acheive your goals, likely
integrating with publicly accessible API's like GPT. I want you to be able to mark off goals in real time as you complete them, as well as in the future. 

For a detailed descriptions of features I intend to add, see the wiki "Feature overview" page.
